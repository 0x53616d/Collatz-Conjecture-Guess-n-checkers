# Collatz-Conjecture-Guess-n-checkers
A couple apps I wrote to check numbers against the Collatz Conjecture.
# Which app is better? Why are there 2?
There are 2 apps because the GUI winform wasn't very fast, so I went to python and made another in search of speed. The python app is exponentially faster, and also keeps track of the highest numbers reached. The GUI is a bit more user friendly if your'e not very experienced with programming.
# What is the purpose of this?
There really is none, I just made these for fun and to visualize. This is especially useless considering all numbers up to 2^86 have already been checked, and these apps will cease to work at 2^64, due to the int size exceeding the maximum allowed in a 64 bit sined integer.
